HiFinder is a modern React-based web application that lets users search any GitHub username and instantly view detailed profile information. It features a clean, glass-morphism UI built with Tailwind CSS, smooth icons from Lucide React, and a global light/dark theme toggle powered by React Context. The app uses the GitHub public API to fetch real-time data and applies a full-viewport responsive design with a fixed modern header for a polished, professional user experience.
